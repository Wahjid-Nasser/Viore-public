More personalized experiences, improved service, and more effective marketing—key drivers for customer satisfaction and loyalty.\n\n## Salesforce Core Values and Commitment to Community\n\nSalesforce’s platform is built on a foundation of core values that shape its culture and business approach. One standout is the company’s commitment to community, exemplified by the one, one, one model—dedicating resources to support communities globally. These values influence how Salesforce operates and partners with customers, ensuring that business growth goes hand-in-hand with social responsibility.\n\n## The Salesforce Explained Series: Learning and Community Engagement\n\nFor professionals eager to deepen their understanding, the 'Salesforce Explained' series offers accessible, ongoing learning.
